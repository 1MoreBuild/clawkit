# openclaw-plugin (Phase 2 placeholder)

This directory is reserved for a future OpenClaw plugin adapter that can wrap `byr-cli` capabilities.

Current phase only ships:

- CLI package (`src/*`)
- package-local ClawHub skill (`skill-openclaw/*`)

Do not add runtime plugin logic here until the CLI contract is stable.
